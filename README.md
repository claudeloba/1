Goal: To create a to-do app, with functionality to add list of todos, edit todos, add users, view users todos. I wanted to test myself so I created a social media app with similar functionality.

You can follow people, see their posts (todos), post comments under posts ( = list of todos), edit your profile and upload and use pictures.
